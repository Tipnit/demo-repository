                    <p>A successful budget planner helps you decide how to best spend your money while avoiding or
                        reducing debt.
                        Tipnit recommends the 50/30/20 budget, which suggests that 50% of your income goes toward needs,
                        30% toward wants and 20% toward savings and debt repayment your remaining amount will be your
                        total.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                        <p>
                            The best budget planner is one you can live with, so tweak your approach as needed.
                            For example, the 50/30/20 breakdown is a recommendation to help you get started.
                            Adjust your spending as needed until you reach your ideal budget.

                    <h3 className="display 5 text-center">Budget to zero before the month begins.</h3>
                    <br/>
                        <p className="text-center">This means before the month even starts, you’re making a plan and
                            giving every dollar a name.
                            It’s called a zero-based budget. Now that doesn’t mean you have zero dollars in your bank
                            account
                            It just means your income minus all your expenses equals zero.</p>

                            <br/>
                                <h3 className="display 5 text-center">Remember that every month is different.</h3>
                                <br/>
                                    <p className="text-center">Some months you’ll have to budget for things like
                                        back-to-school supplies or routine car maintenance.
                                        Other months you’ll be saving for things like vacations, birthdays and holidays.
                                        Regardless of the occasion,
                                        make sure you prepare for those expenses in the budget. Keep those special
                                        occasions from sneaking up on you by pulling
                                        up your calendar while you’re creating your budget.
                                        (Hint:Christmas is in December again this year, guys!)

                                        Be sure to adjust your budget each month as things change. Make a savings fund
                                        you can stash cash in throughout the year.
                                        When you don’t have a plan, you’re going to be stressed. And that takes all the
                                        fun out of giving and celebrating. No one wants that!</p>
