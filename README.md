## Overview
### Description
A web that calculates your monthly expense based on necessary basis by considering your lifestyle. It is used for students to have an idea how much they required a month and whether they need aid. It would help them to keep track off their budget and unnecessary spending.
## App Evaluation
###	Category 
Informative
###	Story 
   Taking input from the users, such as bills, allowance, and such. It will ask question about necessaries such as rent, utilities, phone bill and to those that have pets, car and or kids related questions. After taking account their monthly spending, if they are making less than they require, referring them to places that can assist them financially.
###	Market 
It is designed for college students of all ages, though anyone could also use it. For the categories that are not apply to some, they would be optional, or the input could be 0 but not less then. 
###	Habit 
This website could be used as often as the user would like. If their expense has either increase or decrease, they could use it again to see by how much.
### Scope 
The first we would ask would be basic questions such as, do you pay rent. Then the questions would get more detailed depending on the individual. After asking questions and getting the input, the result would be display to the users but not save to the website for privacy purpose. But based on the result, we would provide more aids if needed. The goal is to be as accurate as possible. They would also have the option to send the result directly to their email. The use of API would be needed for not only their location but to direct them to more aid based on their result.
